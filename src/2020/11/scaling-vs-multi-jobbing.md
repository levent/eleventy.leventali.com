# Scaling vs multi-jobbing

At some point in your career, you may step in to temporarily manage a second or even third team. As an engineering manager, this could mean you now line manage twice the amount of people (or more), and you'll have to context switch between different products or areas of ownership. This could be a growth opportunity and great career move. This could also easily lead to burnout and still be seen as a good career move.

**If you can do one job well, you can't do two jobs "the same" well**.

It's important to scale yourself deliberately which involves, strict prioritisation (what are you going to stop doing), calendar management (put those priorities into practice) and communication (setting expectations with your reports and your leaders). You're not doing two jobs, you're doing your job differently (you're doing a different job). As a Group Engineering Manager I've been _multi-jobbing_ as an EM and a GEM for almost a year. It's even more important to be deliberate as you are essentially scaling yourself along the x-axis (taking on more people and teams) and the y-axis (at different strategic zoom levels).

1. You have to drop > delegate > descope your projects
2. You have to clearly manage your calendar so you can context and zoom shift
3. You have to set clear expectations with everyone on what you will and won't support

## What I would do differently in hindsight

One thing I did get wrong this year was not being explicit and honest up front on how long I would be operating in both roles. This would have changed my approach to the three points above. I had subconsciously planned for a quarter not a year.
