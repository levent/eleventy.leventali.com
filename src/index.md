# I'm Levent Ali.

## Group Engineering Manager at [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/).

I get talented people together and get out of their way.

I'm a technology leader with almost two decades experience delivering internet products and building highly engaged cross-functional teams.

At Intercom a few of the areas where I've had impact:

- Helping establish the London R&D office
- Setting up our first chat bot focussed product team
- Establishing and leading the automated support group
- Improving our engineer onboarding process
- Hiring product managers, directors, and engineers
- Shipping strategic cross org projects, without burnout and on time

My teams work on our automated support solutions, including [Resolution Bot](https://www.intercom.com/automated-answers), [Custom Bots](https://www.intercom.com/customizable-bots) and [Help Center Articles](https://www.intercom.com/articles).

I have previously worked with [Xively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xively), [Goodlord](https://www.goodlord.co/), [Osper](https://osper.com/), [LogMeIn](https://secure.logmein.com/home/en) and [Umbrellium](http://umbrellium.co.uk/).
